SPRINGBOOT CRUD OPERATION

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project using Spring Boot! I've implemented a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing employees. Leveraging Spring Boot's powerful capabilities, I've structured the application into layers: a Employee entity defined with JPA annotations, a EmployeeRepository interface for database operations, and a EmployeeService handling business logic. The RESTful EmployeeController exposes endpoints for managing employee data via HTTP requests. Now, I can effortlessly retrieve, add, update, and delete employee records with ease and efficiency. Stay tuned as I continue to refine and expand this application! ðŸŒŸðŸ’» #SpringBoot #CRUD #Java #DeveloperLife
